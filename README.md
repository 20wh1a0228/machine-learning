EMPOLYEE ATTRITION PREDICTION

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To predict employee attrition using Ensemble learning algorithms
● explore the employee attrition dataset
● apply Random forest and XgBoost on the dataset
● tune the model hyperparameters to improve accuracy
● evaluate the model using suitable metrics

INTRODUCTION:-
Employee attrition is the gradual reduction in employee numbers. Employee attrition
happens when the size of your workforce diminishes over time. This means that
employees are leaving faster than they are hired. Employee attrition happens when
employees retire, resign, or simply aren't replaced. Although employee attrition can be
company-wide, it may also be confined to specific parts of a business.
Employee attrition can happen for several reasons. These include unhappiness about
employee benefits or the pay structure, a lack of employee development opportunities,
and even poor conditions in the workplace.
